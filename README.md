# qqwing-gui-svg-png-jpg-output

A small python script that controls qqwing.exe and enables users to create sudoku puzzles with a user friendly GUI and export to SVG, JPG, JPG or PPTX using PowerPoint as a canvas to draw the Sudoku puzzles.

To run without watermark you need to either have an Aspose.Slides license OR download the executable under releases - https://github.com/bowespublishing/qqwing-gui-svg-png-jpg-output/releases/tag/v0.01 - as it uses python-pptx to build the sudoku puzzle on a slide and then Aspose.Slides to export as PNG, SVG, JPG etc...

You will also need to place qqwing in the same place as the executable or the run.py. You can grab that here - https://qqwing.com/

You can watch a video on how to use the executable here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEYGBlDzrpc
